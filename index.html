        <p class="intro">Financial Literacy is the understanding of how to earn, manage, and invest money.<br>
            Though many people struggle with financial literacy, often because of the lack of understanding.<br>
            Financial literacy is important as it helps people to make informed decisions with their money.<br>
            By teaching finanical literacy in schools, students at an early age can<br> gain the essential skills, such
            as budgeting, saving, and understanding credit.

        <P>These financial literacy rates amoung several U.S. states are quote low for adults. Less than half the adults survyed
            <br> for the listed states answered the majority of finance questions correct. 
            <br> These adults most likley had a lack of finance education which contributed
            <br> to these low rates. If the majority of schools introduced
            <br> and taught financial literacy, the rates in each state would be clearly greater, improving finance choices.
