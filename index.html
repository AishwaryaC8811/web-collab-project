            <br>These are essentialy the amount of adults in each state with sufficient knowlage of finances
        

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>U.S. States</th>
                    <th>Financial Literacy Rates</th>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>Minnesota</td>
                    <td>34.8%</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Wisconsin</td>
                    <td>34.46%</td>
                </tr>

                    <td>20.2%</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        <P>These financial literacy rates amoung several U.S. states are quote low for adults. Less than half the adults survyed
            <br> for the listed states answered the majority of finance questions correct. 
            <br> These adults most likley had a lack of finance education which contributed
            <br> to these low rates. If the majority of schools introduced
            <br> and taught financial literacy, the rates in each state would be clearly greater, improving finance choices.
